c is the first programming language I ever learned. But I never get into it and never did something useful.
Then I used Delphi to do some rudimentary calculation.
I used VB.Net to create application, connect to Oracle DB, deal with user role, connect a FTP, integrate to a UG design. However I still failed it.
I never really understand programming.
However, I know it's so easy and fast to make a windows application using VS. I will keep trying.
